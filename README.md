# TCRS - Tennis Court Reservation System
This is a web-based reservation system for tennis courts.

There is no working code yet.
 
For the first version we are planning to provide a complete web-based application in Angular2 and Spring which can be run in a Docker container.

So far following features are planned:

- online reservation for tennis courts (main requirement)
- multiple clubs with club-admin role
- multiple courts per club
- user registration with Facebook Connect and Google Authentication
